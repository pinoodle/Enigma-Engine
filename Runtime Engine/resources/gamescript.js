Justin has bitten into the √©clair, narrowly avoiding your feet. Intentionally, you guess. He's toying with you, trying to scare you out of your wits. As much as you hate to admit it, it's working; your heart is beating so fast it feels like it's about to explode. You stare into the dark abyss of the jackal's throat. Is that your destiny? Is that really the last thing you'll ever see? Is his hot, musty breath the last thing you'll ever smell?<br><br>You wipe sticky drool from your face, replacing it with whipped cream. It's a case of 'pick your poison', you suppose. How did his drool get on your face, anyway? You haven't touched his tongue or anything. Your face must have broken a few of those gleaming strands of saliva you saw earlier as it entered the jackal's maw, you suppose. <br><br>Everything's still for now. Why isn't he doing anything? Is he letting you ponder on your fate, stew in your fear before he chomps down on you? That's cruel, even for a heartless bastard like him. Just as you think that, Justin's teeth come down and bite off a chunk of the √©clair. He begins to chew, purposefully avoiding you‚Ä¶ for now. His mouth begins to water, the previously solid pastry around you soaking it all up, slowly turning into mush.<br><br><em>Squelch. Squelch. Squelch.</em><br><br>There is no more √©clair to shield you now - it's just you in a sea of jackal spit and chewed-up pastry, and you plop onto his soft, warm, drool-covered tongue. It's all you can do to try and keep your head out of all this muck, try to <em>breathe</em>. And when you do, there is no fresh air, just Justin's hot, oxygen-deprived breath. You're so focused on fighting for air and avoiding his teeth that it doesn't occur to you that you should be thinking of a way to escape!<br><br>It's too late now, though; Justin's tongue pushes you to the side of his mouth and, before you can so much as utter the quietest of squeaks, his teeth come down on you with a satisfying crunch.<br><br><em>Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Crunch</em><br><br>Justin looks thoughtful at the bizarre combination of pastry and squirrel in his mouth. It's not great, but it's not awful either. It just <em>is</em>. Protein. You're just some lovely protein to get him through the next few hours, as he works your half-baked song into his next big hit, and then takes full credit for it. <br><br>And who's to stop him? The only person in the world who knows that this song isn't his is currently being sent down to the jackal's gut with a wet <em>gulp!</em><br><br>For the next few hours, you churn violently in the jackal's stomach, which dissolves your flesh and your bones with ease.

And that is vacuuming your ashes off his carpet.

That was kinda fun. Let's get this party started then, shall we? Thanks for your sacrifice! I 'preciate it!"<br><br>He presses his lips against yours in what feels like a kiss. As grossed out as you may be, you cannot pull away, of course, so are forced to lie there motionless as the dingo's warm, sticky drool slowly seeps into your mouth. The "kiss" soon turns into something entirely different, though, as he begins to <em>suck</em>, pulling at something deep within your core. Now, this - this is something you <em>can</em> fight against! You summon all your willpower in an attempt to hold onto your soul and stop it from being sucked up by the dingo's hungry maw. The struggle causes immense pain to your entire body as your soul is being pulled back and forth, like some weird variation of tug of war. <br><br>In the end, though, Jayden wins; having sucked enough of your soul out, he chomps down on it and pulls with all his might, ripping it out of your body before munching down on it. It feels strange in his mouth, like a jello that exists only 50% of the time. He tilts his head back and swallows it with a decisive gulp. <br><br>It's a bizarre experience as you're pulled right out of your body and into the dingo's maw, where his teeth attempt to pulverize you. While it does feel quite unpleasant, they don't seem to do any damage to you. After that unpleasant encounter, you are sucked down into the dark depths of his throat, soaked in sticky dingo drool both on the outside and on the inside. Your descent down his throat is fast, your slippery soul needing no push as gravity makes it race down towards the gurgling stomach below.<br><br>You fall into the acids with a splash, and find your delicate soul melting almost instantly with an angry hiss. Meanwhile, your body, still in the dingo's grasp, turns to dust. Jayden burps, the strange, tingly taste of a squirrel soul still lingering on his tongue. Already he can feel your knowledge begin to course through his veins. And it's a glorious feeling, inspiring a surge of confidence within him. He has no doubt that he could sit down to do an exam right at this very moment, and get a full score. He grins gleefully, already making plans for all the fun he's gonna have, now that he never needs to revise or attend a lecture ever again. <br><br>But, there is one more thing that needs to be taken care of before his life of fun can begin. And that is vacuuming your ashes off his carpet. He does his best, though the vacuum cleaner that the landlord left for them wasn't great, so a handful of your dust would remain embedded in the carpet, to be stomped on by the dingo and to cling to his footpaws for years to come.`);

The only question is <em>when</em>, and <em>who</em> will be lucky enough to fill their guts with one. Well, you have those two answers - your pred is the snake, and your time to get gurgled up is <em>now</em>, and you're content with that. Your final destiny has finally been revealed; all that's left for you to do in this life is relax and let the snake have his way.<br><br>And that's precisely what he does, as he slowly swallows up more and more of your body, until all that's left of you outside his maw is your paws, but those too disappear soon after, and you are reduced to an anonymous bulge traveling towards his gut.

In addition to the acids slowly eating away at your skin, the stomach walls that wrap around you begin to shift and squirm, kneading against you, rubbing those digestive juices into you to speed up digestion.<br><br>The snake is still a cold-blooded creature, though, so digestion will take quite a while. He would laze about in the sun for the next few days to speed up the chemical processes happening within his gut, during which the euphoric effects his poison had on you would slowly wear off, to be replaced by dizziness and confusion from slowly being turned into anonymous chyme. It's insanely uncomfortable, as you're forced to lie in this single position for <em>days</em>, squished tight by the stomach walls, with absolutely nothing to do but stare into the oppressive darkness and feel your flesh slowly melting off of your bones. <br><br>A few more days pass, and the snake spits out a beautifully bleached squirrel skull, which he would make into something sellable - like a necklace or a cup, he wasn't sure yet - and sell it to whoever was ready to shell out cold, hard cash for a dumb squirrel skull.`);

In one of the chairs sits a snow-white squirrel, resting its footpaws on the table, their pawpads a vibrant pink in the firelight.<br><br>"Welcome back," the squirrel says, sipping some liquid from a cup, never taking his eyes off you. No, not <em>you</em> - the <em>gem</em>. Judging by the smell, he's sipping coffee.<br><br>"D-Doctor?"<br><br>"That is correct. Though I'm not really a Doctor. You might know me by another name.

But‚Ä¶ where from?<br><br>"S‚Ä¶ S‚Ä¶ Something beginning with S‚Ä¶"<br><br>The squirrel grins. "Not bad. <em>Snow.</em>"<br><br>Snow. Yes, that's right.

His eyes narrow as he continues, "Not anymore, I'm not."<br><br>"I‚Ä¶ I don't remember‚Ä¶"<br><br>"Come," Snow says. "Give me the gem, and we shall make you remember."<br><br>You're not entirely sure if giving him the gem is a good idea - something is clearly off about this character - but what choice do you have? You can't see an escape route anywhere, and something tells you you shouldn't mess with this squirrel. And you <em>really</em> want your memories back‚Ä¶<br><br>So, slowly, hesitantly, you approach Snow, and give him the gem. <br><br>"Good squirrel," he says, staring with awe at the gem in his paws. "Let's get to work, shall we?"<br><br>He pulls a lever next to the chimney, and you watch in amazement as the chandelier high up above you begins to descend with a loud whirring noise. You move out of the way, and watch as a strange device materializes itself from the ceiling, a device which holds two more gems identical to the one you brought Snow, the only difference being their colors - one is red, and the other one is green.<br><br>There's one empty slot in the device, which is where Snow places the blue gem. As soon as he does so, all three gems begin to glow. Snow presses a button on the machine, which then proceeds to emit an ear-piercing, high-pitched wail. You watch as red, green, and blue <em>lightning</em> is sucked out of each respective gem, making its way along metal rods to a vial at the center of the contraption, filled with a clear liquid.<br><br>The liquid quickly changes color, from being transparent to shimmering with all the colors of the rainbow, while the gems themselves begin to lose their glow, eventually becoming black as night, losing their beauty, losing their awe-inspiring <em>power</em>. <br><br>Once the process is complete, Snow grabs the vial, dumps its contents into his coffee, mixes it around with a teaspoon, and then drinks the mixture. Almost instantly, his fur changes color in a similar vain to the liquid he just drank, from snow-white to a <em>glowing</em> white that seems to vaguely shimmer with all the colors of the rainbow. Snow begins to shudder violently. Concerned, you take a few steps back, but he eventually regains control of himself.<br><br>"What the-"<br><br>Snow holds up a paw to silence you. "The Chrophenite gems are the <em>heart</em> of our planet. Why do you think we are the only planet in the entire Universe that has <em>life</em> in it?"<br><br>He makes his way over to the table by the fireplace, and scoops something up from a bowl, curling his fingers around it into a fist. <br><br>"It's because of these gems and their power," he continues. "There is a lot I still don't understand about these gems and how they work. But I do know that they require sacrifices, they require <em>blood</em>. Without it, their power begins to wane. Ancient humans understood that, but this knowledge was eventually lost to time, and life itself began to dwindle. Diseases spread like wildfire, waters turned into poison, magic disappeared off the face of the earth."<br><br>Snow walks back towards you. He stands right in front of you, so close that you can smell the coffee on his warm breath, his eyes regarding you curiously. "And now, their power is within <em>me</em>. I am now a <em>god</em>, the source of what little life remains on this planet. With the power of the gems, I am now able to give you back what I have taken away; I can give you back your memories."<br><br>"Wait‚Ä¶ <em>you</em> took them away?! How? <em>Why</em>?"<br><br>Snow shrugs. "After you defeated me, and turned my rat army into nothing more than cockroaches, to be eaten and trodden upon by the island's inhabitants, I learned that The Device, protected by that blasted mink, was nothing more than a mere replica of something called a Chrophenite gem, a replica made by the humans as a last effort to keep The Darkness away from the island. So I started looking for the <em>real</em> thing, the thing that protected the southern part of the island, the gem itself. I never found it. But <em>you</em> did."<br><br>"But-"<br><br>Snow once again holds up a paw to silence you.<br><br>"But you had no idea the gem's power was waning," Snow continues. "When it became so weak that it could no longer protect the island, and The Darkness started devouring everything, you took all the squirrels you could find that were still unaffected by The Darkness, and rushed to the gem. It indeed protected the ten of you from The Darkness‚Ä¶ but not from <em>me</em>. I found you, I pacified you, I took the gem. Then I cleared your memories, and made you all get me the <em>second</em> gem from the Isle of Frost using this teleporter the humans left behind when they disappeared. Then I cleared your memories <em>again</em>, and made you get me this final gem from the Isle of Zing, which you just saw being devoured by The Darkness as well, since they no longer have their gem. That dumb snake had no idea what he was selling!"<br><br>"That means‚Ä¶ the whole world‚Ä¶"<br><br>"Is now shrouded by darkness. By evil. Correct! But let's not get ahead of ourselves. You need to remember these things <em>yourself</em>. So let me finally restore your memories. But, to do so, I need to restore the gems' power a little. With a sacrifice."<br><br>Snow uncurls his fingers, revealing what it was that he scooped out of the bowl earlier - ${pl.lives - 1} tiny squirrels sitting in the palm of his hand, shaking with terror, their fur plastered against their skin, soaking wet from being held so long in Snow's clammy paw.<br><br>"The size makes things easier.

Snow speaks only once both of his paws are squeaky clean. <br><br>"Good squirrel. Having all this new power to play with, I'm not as mad at you as I once was."<br><br>He reaches towards you and touches your injured paw. You flinch, but he doesn't hurt you; in the blink of an eye, you find that your paw is once again whole, as if nothing ever happened to it. You stare at it in amazement. <br><br>"You know, there was a time when I daydreamed of sinking my teeth into your throat and tasting your red, hot blood on my tongue as you begged for mercy," Snow continues. "I suppose that dream is somewhat fulfilled now! I'm willing to forget your transgressions. What you do now is up to you. You can go out there and look for a way to get rid of The Darkness, if you want. Even <em>I</em> can't help you with that, as we would need <em>thousands</em> of years' worth of sacrifices to restore the gems' power to what it once was.
