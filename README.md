# Noodle Engine v4.0
A text adventure game engine created as a simple, cross-platform, lightweight alternative to Quest (http://textadventures.co.uk/quest).

v4.0 is currently under development! It aims to finalize the engine into a clean, finished product.

## How to Run the Program
You can use the online version of the Editor here: https://pinoodle.github.io/Enigma-Engine/

The Editor can also be installed as a PWA on Chromium-based browsers, which works even when offline.

Your game data is not stored in the cloud and never leaves your PC - once loaded, the Editor runs fully offline on your PC.

Alternatively, download and extract the .zip file of this repository and open the "index.html" file in your favourite browser to load the Editor.

## How to Export the Game
Once you've finished your game in the Editor, you can click on "Export Gamescript", which will generate a "gamescript.js" file for you.

Now xopy and paste the "Runtime Engine" folder anywhere you like and rename it to anything you like (e.g. "Forest Adventure"). Then you'd drag-and-drop the "gamescript.js" file into "Forest Adventure/resources", and click on "index.html" to play the game!

## Features
* MAP: Automatic map generation.
* MULTIMEDIA SUPPORT: Supports audio and images.
* GAME-SAVING: In-built game-saving mechanism.
* CROSS-PLATFORM: Both the Editor and the generated games run in the browser, so they're fully cross-platform. The generated games also have an adaptable UI that is usable on both mobiles and PCs.
* LIGHTWEIGHT: As the Runtime Engine has been written from scratch in vanilla JavaScript and does not depend on any third-party libraries, the games produced by this engine are incredibly lightweight - an empty game is just over 60KB!
* POWERFUL: You can extend the built-in functionality with your own JavaScript, so there's no limits to what you can do!
